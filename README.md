## About

<p>This is a project from the Basic HTML Page Structure section of The Odin Project's HTML and CSS course.<br>
In this project, you are required to build a webpage that contains an embedded youtube video.<p>

<h5>Project Goal</h5>
<p>From the assignment:</p>

<blockquote>The goal here isn’t to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things – embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.</blockquote>
